There is only one script included in my submission. The script has six sections. 
The first is to set up the folder and install packages, and download the source file.
After that, there is one for each of the tasks we were supposed to do.

I added comments in the script so that it's easy to see what's happening.

featuresFrame: Contains the names of all of the measures
trainFrame: All of the measurements for the training data set
testFrame: All of the measurements for the test data set

combinedFrame: The combination of the training measurements and test measurements

meansAndStdFrame: The end of task 2. Contains only the means and standard deviation measurements

meansAndStdAndActivitiesFrame$Activity: The data set for part 3. Has all of the activities named.

The rest of the dataframes are my attempts to create the final for part 5. I didn't finish.
